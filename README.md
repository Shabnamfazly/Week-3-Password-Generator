## Week-3-Password-Generator

## Description
For this challenge my task was to modify some javascript starter code to create a website that will allow the user to generate random passowrds with a certain criteria that they've chosen.When the user clicks the 'generate password' button they will be prompted to choose from the following criteria:
* Number of characters
* Special characters 
* Numeric characters
* Lowercase characters
* Uppercase characters
The application validates the user input and ensures that at least one character type has to be selected. After all the prompts have been answered, the user will then be presented with a password.
