## Week-3-Password-Generator

## Description
For this challenge my task was to modify some javascript starter code to create a website that will allow the user to generate random passowrds with a certain criteria that they've chosen.When the user clicks the 'generate password' button they will be prompted to choose from the following criteria:
* Number of characters
* Special characters 
* Numeric characters
* Lowercase characters
* Uppercase characters
The application validates the user input and ensures that at least one character type has to be selected. After all the prompts have been answered, the user will then be presented with a password.
This would be very useful for companies that handle large amounts of sensitive data as weak passwords can pose a huge security threat and cause data leaks. So this would be a ideal application to generate strong passwords effortlessly  to save time as well as ensuring secure access to data.

## Usage 
The application is simple to use with just click of a button which then leads to the user being asked to answer some simple prompts so the application can meet the criteria of their required password. The password will the be displayed on the screen.
